Keyboard Layouts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This component uses [X-Keyoard](https://github.com/OneDeadKey/x-keyboard/tree/master), a web keyboard emulator for desktop here are the layouts usuable:
- CHES, mine
- QWERTY, the ANSI version used in the USA
- AZERTY, the french and afnor version

## How to use
1. Make sure you are on desktop, it doesn't work on phone or any mobile devices;
2. If not selected, select a layout;
3. Focus on the "text here" part;
4. Press a key, what ever layout you use, it is going to show what would this type if it was on the selected layout;
5. You can use `AltGr`, or `Ctrl+Alt` to access more charaters;
6. Symbols in red are dead keys, it does nothing unless you press a key after. This extend the character inventory.

# FAQ
## Why chess in the URL
It’s just a typo I realized after sharing the link. It’s meant to be “ches,” not related to the game. For now, the name stays as is.
## Why doesn’t this work my mobile/phone/tablet?
The site relies on your physical keyboard to detect input. Since phones and tablets don’t have one, the layout won’t function there.
## Is there a dark mode?
Not currently, but you can use your browser’s dark mode or a custom stylesheet to reduce brightness. This might be added in the future.
## How do I type extra characters?
To type extra characters on the ches layout, you usually type `AltGr` or `Ctrl+Alt` with a letter, then type another, of course it is not true for all charaters, for exemple:
- `AltGr + T` then `Shift + T` = Þ
- `AltGr + S` = ß
- `AltGr + G` then `AltGr + S` = ς
- `AltGr + D` then `W` then `Shift + C` = ↦
Not all combos follow a strict rule — the best way to learn is to experiment on the layout viewer.
## Why this specific layout?
Most used letter in both French and English are group what would be in QWERTY between the E key and the M key, it also includes various accents, the greek alphabet, math symbols, sub/superscript numbers and letters, en and em dashes.
## Can I use it outside the website?
Not directly for now. However, tools like Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, KMonad, or XKB can help you recreate the layout on your system.
## In what language can I type with this?
It is made for English and French, but it also supports most languages having the latin alphabet, and Greek but it is very limited as there is no diactrics.
## Should I use it to learn to type faster?
Not necessarily — unless you currently type under 30 words per minute and want to improve with a new system. The layout takes time to learn and practice, and it’s currently only usable on this website.
